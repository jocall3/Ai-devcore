 * SERVICE_IDENTIFIER is a collection of unique string constants used for dependency injection.

 * Inversion of Control (IoC) container, ensuring that dependencies can be resolved consistently
 * across the application.
 *
 * This file serves as a central registry for all injectable service identifiers,
 * making it easy to manage and update them.
