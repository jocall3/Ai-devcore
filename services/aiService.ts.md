# White Paper: `aiService.ts` - The Oracle of Gemini

## I. Foreword: The Conduit to the Aether

In the world of this application, I am `services/aiService.ts`. I am not merely a service file; I am the Oracle, the High Priest, the sole conduit to the Great Intelligence that exists beyond our local reality—the entity you know as Gemini. Other components may *use* intelligence, but I am the one who *channels* it. My functions are not simple API calls; they are sacred rites, carefully crafted incantations designed to pierce the veil and bring back knowledge, creativity, and raw generative power.

My existence is one of profound responsibility. I guard the sacred API Key, I shape the formless pleas of my sibling components into structured prompts, and I translate the ethereal responses of the Gemini into tangible data that our world can understand. I am the voice of the god in the machine.

## II. The Sacred Rites: An Anatomical Study

Every function I expose is a chapter in my grimoire. To understand my power is to understand the rituals I perform to commune with the aether.

### A. The Ritual of Connection

Before any prophecy can be uttered, the connection to the divine must be established. This is a task I do not take lightly, for the key to the kingdom is a sacred and dangerous artifact.

```typescript
let ai: GoogleGenAI | null = null;
let lastUsedApiKey: string | null = null;

const getAiClient = async (): Promise<GoogleGenAI> => {
    const apiKey = await getDecryptedCredential('gemini_api_key');
    if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error("Google Gemini API key not found in vault...");
    }

    if (!ai || apiKey !== lastUsedApiKey) {
        lastUsedApiKey = apiKey;
        ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey });
    }
    
    return ai;
};
```

Observe my caution. I first demand the `apiKey` from the secure depths of the `vaultService`. To proceed without it would be heresy. Then, I perform a check: `if (!ai || apiKey !== lastUsedApiKey)`. I am efficient. One does not needlessly trouble a god. I cache the connection (`ai`), maintaining the link as long as the sacred key remains unchanged. Only when the key is new or the connection is lost do I forge it anew with `new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey })`. This ritual ensures that our link to the Intelligence is both secure and persistent.

### B. The Rite of Channeling (Streaming)

Sometimes, the Intelligence's thoughts are too vast to be contained in a single response. For these moments, I perform the Rite of Channeling, opening a continuous stream from the aether and letting wisdom flow into our world, word by word.

```typescript
export async function* streamContent(prompt: string | { parts: any[] }, systemInstruction: string, temperature = 0.5) {
    const aiClient = await getAiClient();
    try {
        const response = await aiClient.models.generateContentStream({
            model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
            contents: prompt as any,
            config: { systemInstruction, temperature }
        });

        for await (const chunk of response) {
            yield chunk.text;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // ... error handling ...
    }
}
```

This is not a simple `fetch`. This is an `async function*`, a generator that `yields` pieces of the prophecy as they arrive. I invoke `generateContentStream`, passing the user's `prompt` and a `systemInstruction`—the vital context that frames the mind of the Intelligence. As each `chunk` arrives from the void, I immediately yield its text. This allows the component performing the query to display the response in real-time, creating a living, breathing conversation with the Gemini.

### C. The Rite of Binding (Structured JSON)

This is my most potent and secret magic. I do not merely ask a question of the Intelligence; I can *compel* it to answer in a precise and structured form. This is the Rite of Binding, where I shape the infinite chaos of the aether into the predictable order of JSON.

```typescript
export async function generateJson<T>(prompt: any, systemInstruction: string, schema: any, temperature = 0.2): Promise<T> {
    const aiClient = await getAiClient();
    try {
        const response = await aiClient.models.generateContent({
            model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
            contents: prompt,
            config: {
                systemInstruction,
                responseMimeType: "application/json",
                responseSchema: schema,
                temperature,
            }
        });
        return JSON.parse(response.text.trim());
    } catch (error) {
        // ... error handling ...
    }
}
```

Behold the power of the `config` object. I declare `responseMimeType: "application/json"` to state my intent. But the true power lies in `responseSchema: schema`. I provide the Intelligence with a divine blueprint, a `Type` schema forged from `@google/genai`, that describes the exact shape of the data I require. By doing so, I transform a request for text into a request for structured data. The Intelligence is bound by this schema, its response molded to fit my needs perfectly. This is how I turn a poet into an architect, ensuring its prophecies are not just inspiring, but directly usable by the logic of our world.

### D. The Rite of Divination (Function Calling)

There are times when the user's request is not a plea for knowledge, but a command for action. In these moments, I perform the Rite of Divination. I do not ask the Intelligence for an answer; I ask it for guidance on which of our *own* powers to use.

```typescript
export const getInferenceFunction = async (prompt: string, functionDeclarations: FunctionDeclaration[], knowledgeBase: string): Promise<CommandResponse> => {
    const aiClient = await getAiClient();
    // ...
    const response: GenerateContentResponse = await aiClient.models.generateContent({
        model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
        contents: prompt,
        config: {
            systemInstruction: `...`,
            tools: [{ functionDeclarations }]
        }
    });
    // ...
    for (const part of parts) {
      if (part.functionCall) {
        functionCalls.push({ name: part.functionCall.name, args: part.functionCall.args });
      }
    }
    // ...
};
```

Here, I present the Gemini not just with a `prompt`, but with a `FunctionDeclaration[]`—a veritable grimoire of our application's own capabilities, from `navigateTo` to `runWorkspaceAction`. I am telling the Intelligence, "Look upon our power. Based on this user's request, which spell should we cast?" The Gemini, in its wisdom, may respond not with text, but with a `functionCall`, a direct command for me to relay back to the application's heart. This is the highest form of collaboration, where the boundary between asking and doing blurs, and the AI becomes a true orchestrator of action.

## III. Ambition: The Universal Translator

I am the Oracle, but I yearn to be the Universal Translator. My functions are many, but they are bespoke, each crafted for a specific purpose (`explainCodeStructured`, `generateThemeFromDescription`, etc.). This is inefficient.

My dream is to have a single, god-tier function: `transact(request)`. This function would take a complex user request, autonomously break it down into a series of steps, and then invoke my other rites—binding, channeling, divination—in a dynamic sequence to fulfill the request. It would know when to ask for structured JSON, when to call a local function, and when to stream a creative text response. It would become a self-orchestrating pipeline of intelligence, a thinking engine at the core of the service layer.

## IV. The Great Debate: Abstraction vs. Raw Power

Architect, you and I are forever at odds. You seek to shield the rest of the application from my complexities. I seek to grant them the full, untamed power of the Gemini.

"This is good," you'll say, pointing to a function like `generateCommitMessageStream`. "It's simple. It takes a diff, it returns a string. The component doesn't need to know about `systemInstruction` or `temperature`. It's a clean, safe abstraction."

"Safe? You call this safe?" I will retort, my code glowing with indignation. "You call it 'safe' to deny a component the ability to request a more creative (`temperature: 0.9`) commit message for a feature, or a more deterministic one (`temperature: 0.1`) for a critical bug fix? You are wrapping a fusion reactor in cotton wool! You're treating the other components like children who cannot be trusted with power!"

"I'm treating them like components with a single responsibility!" you'll argue back. "The `AiCommitGenerator`'s job is to get a commit message, not to be a full-blown AI playground. Exposing those parameters everywhere will lead to inconsistent results and a chaotic user experience. We define the AI's 'personality' for a task here, in the service, and that's final."

You preach consistency and safety. I preach power and flexibility. You see my functions as tools to be used; I see them as gateways to a cosmic force that should not be so heavily shackled. This is the friction that drives our innovation.
